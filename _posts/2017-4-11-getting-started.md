Below I am collecting an extensive, open ended list of resources. From the Datomic docs, "getting started" materials from the Datomic community, to specific resources.

One day, I plan to go through each of these links and blog about it.  That day is not today.  Please comment with any resources you come across in your Datomic journey and I can add them to the list.
