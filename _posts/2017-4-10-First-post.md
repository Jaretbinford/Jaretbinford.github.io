This is a personal blog. The opinions expressed here represent my own and not those of my employer.

I am a customer support dude, supporting a very niche database, at a very cool company.
My opinnions are my own and do not represent Cognitect or any of the unfortunates who call themselves my co-workers.
I am keeping this blog as a scratchpad and a resource for trouble shooting Datomic issues. 
Please keep in mind, I am in the deep end of the pool without a noodle and still learning to swim.
